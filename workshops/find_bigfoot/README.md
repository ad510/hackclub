## Part 1: Set up the project

If you've done other Hack Camp workshops before, this should be pretty straightforward.

### 1) Create a blank HTML file

1. Go to https://c9.io
2. Under the workspace called `USERNAME.github.io` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username, click **Open** to open the workspace.
3. Make a new folder called `find_bigfoot`.
4. In the `find_bigfoot` folder, make a new file called `index.html`.
5. Double-click `index.html` to open the file.

### 2) Add standard HTML template

Type the standard HTML template into `index.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
</html>
```

### 3) Open the live preview

1. Click **File > Save** to save the file.
2. Click **Preview > Live Preview File** to open a live preview of the web page. Currently it is blank but that will change soon!
